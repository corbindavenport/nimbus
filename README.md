__New in Nimbus 2.2:__
* Nimbus now has more options for sharing the current weather map.
* More detailed error messages where possible.
* Fixes dozens of bugs with Firefox OS.
* Updated to support new Freese-Notis Weather API for radar maps.
* And lots of other bug fixes and small improvements!

__New in Nimbus 2.1:__
* **Updated radar player**: The new radar map player introduced in 2.0 has been updated to fix loading and playback problems. The old player has also received improvements and minor fixes.
* **Faster loading**: Nimbus 2.1 uses asynchronous loading to enhance performance, especially when using the old radar player.
* And lots of bug fixes and small improvements!

__New in Nimbus 2.0:__
* **New icon**: Nimbus has a shiny new icon!
* **Improved radar**: Nimbus now uses an HTML5 radar map player, powered by [Gfycat](http://www.gfycat.com). The old radar can be re-enabled in settings.
* **New forecast layout**: The forecast screen has been updated with a cleaner layout.
* **New weather icons**: Nimbus now uses [Weather Icons by Erik Flowers](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) instead of Google Now-style icons.
* **Moved settings button**: The settings button no longer hovers on the screen. It is now located at the bottom of the Current tab.
* And lots of bug fixes and small improvements!

*Note: Older devices and browsers may have problems with the new radar map player, due to it's use of HTML5 video. If this occurs to you, just switch 'New radar player' to off in the Nimbus settings.*
