---------------------------------------------------------

__New in Nimbus 2.1:__
* **Updated radar player**: The new radar map player introduced in 2.0 has been updated to fix loading and playback problems. The old player has also received improvements and minor fixes.
* **Faster loading**: Nimbus 2.1 uses asynchronous loading to enhance performance, especially when using the old radar player.
* And lots of bug fixes and small improvements!

__New in Nimbus 2.0:__
* **New icon**: Nimbus has a shiny new icon!
* **Improved radar**: Nimbus now uses an HTML5 radar map player, powered by [Gfycat](http://www.gfycat.com). The old radar can be re-enabled in settings.
* **New forecast layout**: The forecast screen has been updated with a cleaner layout.
* **New weather icons**: Nimbus now uses [Weather Icons by Erik Flowers](http://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/) instead of Google Now-style icons.
* **Moved settings button**: The settings button no longer hovers on the screen. It is now located at the bottom of the Current tab.
* And lots of bug fixes and small improvements!

*Note: Older devices and browsers may have problems with the new radar map player, due to it's use of HTML5 video. If this occurs to you, just switch 'New radar player' to off in the Nimbus settings.*

__New in Nimbus 1.2:__
* **Enhanced Settings**: The settings panel in Nimbus has been updated for better usability, and with even more customization!
* **Better location**: Nimbus 1.2 no longer needs the international switch that 1.1 added, thanks to improved location detection.
* And lots of bug fixes and UI improvements!

__New in Nimbus 1.1:__
* **International Support**: Nimbus now officially supports locations outside the United States!
* **Share map**: You can now share the current radar map for your location with the new Share button. This will upload the current map as an animated GIF image to [imgur.com](http://imgur.com/), ready to share online!
* And lots of bug fixes and UI improvements!

__New in Nimbus 1.0:__
* Initial release!
